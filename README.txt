   using the iris data set.
   Run the code main.m
 2)rbf_som: this folder contains two scripts: rbf_entropy.m and
   rbf_entropy2.m , the value of sigma have been calculated in 
   a different way in both the scripts. fmincg has been used to decrease the 
   cost function.
 3)rbf_som_GradientDes: this folder contains the same code as rbf_som but 
   gradient descent has been used to minimize the cost/error function.
